Hypergraph where nodes are food ingredients, hyperedges are recipes made from combining multiple ingredients and categories indicate cuisine (e.g., "Southern-US", "Indian", "Spanish"). Raw data was obtained from the "What's Cooking?" Kaggle competition. Some summary statistics of the network are:

    number of nodes: 6,714
    number of hyperedges: 39,774
    number of edge label categories: 20
    rank of hypergraph (maximum hyperedge size): 65
